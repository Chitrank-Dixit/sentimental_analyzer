Good app.,0
Best application for renting everything you can definitely go for the application help me out a lot with the best application service available out there,0
This is really cool I totally love this application is way better than you can I expect of anything,0
"I had placed an order for lehnga and on the day of delivery only I had to follow on it when it didn't reach,on which they mentioned that lehnga was missing.No msgs or email from their side which was highly irresponsible and unprofessional .If they had informed in time,I could have arranged for something .So I would highly suggest not to rely on this spcly if you are planning to rent on special day.They will spoil ur day and would copy paste the standard apology mail as I have seen for oder bad reviews here",0
One of the most useful applications available houses for rent and services this is way better than awesome I totally love it using this application has helped me to get everything at very cheap prices,0
Instead of buying clothes renting is really cheaper and it is available at every fraction of the amount you can also pay by cash on delivery,0
Hey flyrobe..i wanted to ask that its written rent â¹ abc. So does dt mean its for rent ? Or it will belong to us only afyer dat?,1
You definitely need to try to see how much better this is,0
I had ordered for my friend and it wasn't delivered. Please see.,1
Very bad,0
This is a fraud company. Worst service I booked a jacket which was never delivered to me and at the end moment I have to go and purchase one before the event. There was no response from customer care as well. Don't trust them.,0
I am vry disappointed.Though I booked my order about 20 days prior n they confirmed it too. But They cancelled my order jst five days before delievry date bcz that dress was not available.,0
I did online payement .it came transaction successful and the app automatically got refreshed and money was deducted from my account....no order confirmation also received,0
Why it is on rent only..,0
"I dont know why i did not give a negative review the first time i ordered. Probably that was because i thought things would be better the next time. But no! I have had a horrible experience with flyrobe, not once but consecutively for the fourth time! EarlierAfter a lot of hassle i used to get a dress at the doorstep atleast. But this time you went a step further in proving how mismanaged the whole staff and logistics at your place is. Never ever going to order and waste my time on this useless app/website!",1
What a fu...king app superb chutyapa Security deposit Rs 800. First time I have seen security deposit. First close ur ecommerce business. This is best idea from my side. Best option for u guys.. Now uninstall the app.. Thank for chutyapa...,0
"Well this was my first experience with them and I am sure it was the last. Despite making more than 15 calls to their customer care and getting assured that my outfit will be delivered on time, it wasn't. There was no follow up from the customer care team in respect of delivery time or reason for delay in delivery.After spending all morning and a better half of the afternoon with their customer care, I received the outfit 15 minutes before leaving for the railway station! Extremely disappointing.",0
"A big thanks to flyrobe for providing clothes on rent . great app . i recommend this app to all . it helped me big time with my marriage , my wedding gown was not ready and the wedding day was day after tomorrow . my brother suggested me to use flyrobe as he saw the same wedding gown on flyrbes and also the best part was , they provided it on rent . so it was a great help to me . thank you .",0
Ordered a small size gown for my sister and got the size of a 6 feet tall girl..also the dress was looking very old.,0
"Cant login, website is not user friendly! Read the negative reviews but still tjought to check it up as i need dresses for 7 programs but i cant even login!",1
that you cannot find in many other applications to click woolen Pan application to use for rental services,0
"I didn't receive my outfit. No follow up at all. I called customer care and they told I will get a call but till date no call. It was very disheartening exp, waiting for outfit. Worst service. Will never suggest any one ...",0
Nice collection but of NO use. As they don't answer the calls neither do they revert to mails. And finally after a week when they realize that there is a mail in the inbox.... They reply with standard copy paste answer... They don't even have ethics to go through the entire mail before revert to it with irrelevant answers. Won't ever recommend or use their services.,1
I was order dress bt thn not cnfm and tht it was a rent dress.,0
I don't see their point of creating this app.... No deliveries to the address that is accepted on the app as their service area..... They won't tell you that your order is cancelled or product can't be delivered until the very last moment. In fact they tell you order is confirmed and is to be delivered. Only to cause disappointment by not sending the garment! Create such an app and then don't give the dress!ðð Funny people,0
I have been using the app for a while and flyrobe has never disappointed me even once. I just love shopping from the app as I get to wear the designer outfits at very affordable prices.,0
wow app. A big thanks for making this app far better than roposo. I like using it.,1
"They deliver defect products. My advice please check everything before you accept order. And don't depend on them, always have some backup as returning and changing will take lot of time. In my case, I was too busy and didn't check properly, they have given me size 44 instead of 40. Later, the customer care simply disowned the responsibility.",0
"Dis aap isnt wrking. Firstly it never logins and if anyhow it does, immediately after a second app stops wrking.",0
My aunt wanted to buy a saree to attend a wedding so I suggested her to rent the saree from the flyrobe app as even my mom has done the same . She ordered a saree and I got rs600 coupon on her first purchase .,1
I liked the app but since the deliveries are for certain cities only it was not helpful. Please try coming to other cities or have the dresses delivered.,0
"I was so fascinated by the dresses and their rent prices... I really wanted to rent one of them. But then I got to know that they don't rent in the Navi Mumbai area. If you want to expand your business, you need to expand the area also!!",0
Keeps crashing!,0
Doesn't work... Wanted a tuxedo for a wedding but this app isn't showing anything for Delhi ncr... You guys need to work a lot... Please don't make any app for the sake of it... Just test before releasing....,0
Executives are not at all professional and very rude..my outfit hasn't yet come and my show is due in a day..this has put me in an unnecessary tension and it is so difficult to arrange for the clothing..worst app to try for..,0
I want the services to be extended to guwahati,0
"No response, same repeated answer since so many days , my security deposit rs 1360 has not been credited yet for the order of 11th december. Lost trust completely.",0
awesome app the flyrobe is .it is the coolest shoping app i had seen till now .,0
"When i login in the Flyrobe App, the app force stops whenever i click on My Order. Plz fix it. (Android 6.0)",0
Nyc,1
Rent is too high,0
The collection and designs are good. However the technology and app is very bad. Payment was deducted from my account and the dress has not been booked. Filters not working. And these issues are faced multiple times. The team should definitely look at rectifying these issues else will end up losing customers.,1
"They don't reply,they don't give a response on the chat section, their phones are switched off !! Really bad experience.",0
"Worst service, dint got my security deposit even after 15 days , they want a proof of cash payment , call centre asking their delivery guy that he took payment or not , jaise ki bina payment that guy was gonna handover me the parcel .DUMB people AT flyRObe. Worst , lost trust and never ever gonna use it.",0
Worst app logg in he nahi ho rha hai trying from last 1 hour fake app,0
I ordered one dress today fr the slot 1-3. I m calling the delivery boy from 2pm n continuously he was telling dat he will come. Now it's 6:15 n he stopped picking up my calls.,0
Disappointed as always,0
Only for metro cities...really disappointed,0
I just hate it very unuseble app,0
Not showing anything bullshit,0
There should be an option to just see what products are available at the moment . As I checked and like some but almost all were not available for that particular day .,0
I have been waiting for my refund since last 20 days. I had put the details on website as well as I got a confirmation call for the refund initiation but still no clue. Now they say they don't have my details.,0
Fck app..... Blank screen nothing appears,0
Wanted a suit for 22nd. Couldn't get. Should have more supply per demand.,0
"Your Suits are Limited , If anyone tries to checkout the msg shows some items are missing , kindly choose something else . why??? You are making me Fruatrated ....you haven't mention any policies regarding damage of suit ....what if your items get lost or spoiled by party beverage on suit somehow what will you do to us or what will you take and how will you settle the cost of suit.....Nothing had been written",0
Time waste app,0
this App is not what they are showing in ads,0
Worst app ever... Never deliver there orders. Just fake promises. Not worthy of your time. Dnt even download it,0
Reference code,0
Lol bullshit app,0
Flyrobe is one of the extra ordinary application. This is Fantastic application i have ever seen such application till the date. It shows me latest styles and the best of designer wear.,0
Worst,0
Worst service ever. These guys just dont donot know how to fulfill the commitment. Suprised to see how they are in business,0
All way had bad experience ð,0
Jaipur city is not added in this app... what a crap,0

Abey kolkata mein to yeh hai hi nahin,1
Not available in pune where there is vast market for Them. Really disappointed.,1
Bullshit ad,0
Plz provide an option to sign up with email. I don't want to use my Facebook or Google logins.,0
Rental price is too expensive....instead of getting it on rent one can buy a new cloth of that price...too expensive,0
"BC! instead of sponsorships, you must focus on app development. It's not responding. I couldn't sign up.",0
I hate it because it's not fÃ©vÃ©nt,0
Only available in 5 major cities.. not in ours..,0
Cheap marketing techniques and fake reviews,1
"I came here from fevent app, after so much torture...Finally reached. This was the last comment box here. So this is my last comment. This is last comment with 2star. Do you still think I'll use the app now?",1
"I just installed the app and uninstalled it. After the great reviews, I wanted to give this app a go. But the first page is forceful login page without a skip button, why would I login and share my public info(fb/google) if I just want to browse stuff. Please add a skip button on login page as every other e-comm website and let the visitors browse without forcing them to login.",0
Not in Kolkata,1
I was really excited about the app untill i installed it n saw my city is not there. Add more cities atleast the main cities.,0
FÃ©vÃ©nt is better try it!,0
There's only a few selected cities. I live in Calcutta so I can't use this app.,0
Worst app :/ extremely disappointed,0
Ok,0

I totlly enjoy using this app. Amazing offers are also provided by the app.I have not little bit idea that , the flyrobe app is such a classic app to rent clothes from it.

"When i see the rental price, it look like price of dress. Too costly..",0
For all the new people Use 2CTF1HY to get discount,0
Clothes are good but rent is too costly,0
Products look good but the the service is stupid as you cannot try the product before renting even when one is ready to go to their studio.,0
How can i give review when app is taking too much time to show image of apparels ... since 15minutes m waiting just to see load image of apparels... worst app ever,1
"I had ordered for a lehenga set and an Anarkali set on 15th Jan for delivery on 16th Feb 6pm. A person came to take my measurements as well. On 12th Feb they send me a message saying you will receive your delivery on 16th Feb. I was looking forward for the delivery as I had an event the next day. I get a call on 16th at 3pm telling me that one of the dresses is damaged, I was shocked when I said what do you mean by damaged, the person replied it's not there. It looked like he was making up excuses. They are cheats and will not deliver the items. Please don't waste your money on Flyrobe.",0
There is no shop in Chennai?,0
Flyrobe making fool to all customer and flyrobe has to deliver my dress by today18/02/17 but still flyrobe was not able to delivered and canceled my all plans for today... Worst worst worst company,0
The worst experience ever had.,0
FUDDU,0
This flyrobe app means largest fashion rental platform which is avilable for men shopping and also for women shopping . I am also using this app to rent clothes .,0
High price,0
"you just cant kind find any complaints about this app, it is nice they provide some very nice service plus they also rent clothes, i mean what more could you want?",1
One of the worst app.. for the first time when I tried to book a dress.. Using paytm-credit card.. money was deducted.. But I never got the order confirmed.. I raised a issue with support team.. They keep closing my ticket saying issue solved.. More than a month now.. Still haven't got my money back,1

Pathetic chat interface. Rude unresponsive customer care who say they are too busy to reply to queries. Pathetic operations team which delivers clothes unironed. Poor quality of clothes with buttons which fall off in an hour. Truly a pathetic service.,0
how to get such a lot of offers And discounts on renting garments on line you'll be amazed to discover so many things effortlessly,0
data I love the way I provide all the services so easily that is awesome to use this application from time to time,0
I had received a mail regarding the confirmation of refund of my security deposit 2 weeks back..but I am yet to receive the refund..when contacted them they didn't respond back..dont expect your security deposit amount to be credited in your accnt by flyrobe..i am about to report this issue in consumer Forum. DON'T USE THIS APP..It's a scam,0
Price is way too high.. Wat a crap.. Like fooling people.. How can rent cost u 20k.. Come on.. This is crazy,0
Pathetic Service!,0
"flyrobe app is so much better than ropso app , if you dont belive me then i think you should try it for yourself but i know later on you will agree with me",0

Its a perfect concept.The prices are also very reasonable and have a great collection. Just a small tip- it should have the option of offering our branded stuff for rent too and it should have a bigger collection in western wear and bags and bling. Ordered for the first time a week back and the compliments I got were priceless not to mention because of a coupon I got the order for free. Booking an order once more today and I hope it won't be a disappointment.,1
Loved my outfit but improvements could be made with respect to custom fitting. The outfit I ordered for my sister was quite lose. The trial option could be added to Indian wear also.,0
I just love this app..,0

I ordered 2 dresses from fyrobe and both of them were superb. Was a little disappointed with customer service when I orderd after 8PM for the next day. Customer service should take care of customers even after 8PM.,0
"Amazing experience. The packaging is so cool, even the things we buy online don't come in such good packaging, but a rental dress comes to you like a gift packed for a princess! The service is very good. Quality of the product is great. Thanks team Flyrobe for introducing such an amazing source. Adding to it, I would like it even more if you keep more options in XS sized dresses for skinny girls like me. ðð Lastly, I would recommend everyone to use Flyrobe.",0
