"I ordered a dress on 3rd and set the pick up date as 7th and paid for the extra days too. Despite of that, they kept calling me on 5th and 6th and when I finally told them that the pick up is on 7th , they didn't call on 7th at all. Later, they called me on 8th and set a pick up time but did not pick up my dress. Later they again call me on 9th and 10th and finally picked it up on 10th. Please make your service better. This is a lot to bear when in the beginning I couldn't even place an order from the app.",0,[]

"The collection is nice ( needs more variety soon ) , but the real win is the service. These guys were ready to wait it out till I tried the outfit and decided whether to keep it.

Its a perfect concept.The prices are also very reasonable and have a great collection. Just a small tip- it should have the option of offering our branded stuff for rent too and it should have a bigger collection in western wear and bags and bling. Ordered for the first time a week back and the compliments I got were priceless not to mention because of a coupon I got the order for free. Booking an order once more today and I hope it won't be a disappointment.,1,['tech']
Loved my outfit but improvements could be made with respect to custom fitting. The outfit I ordered for my sister was quite lose. The trial option could be added to Indian wear also.,1,['tech']

Used the app to make a pick up request. The app said a team would reach asap to take custom measurement however didn't get any call for a day so I called up. The team had no idea about the order. Took some while to figure it out and then got back asking to give some details on a form. I submitted that in less than 5 mins however no revert so I called up again but couldn't get any response. Their agent next day calls up very casually saying that we havent got the response !! It's like a total waste.,0,[]

"After seeing the last 3 pathetic reviews, wish i had seen them before. I didnt receive my outfit. No follow up at all. All 3 days i kept on calling on a customer care where no one replies back. No reply to the email. Chats are just waste of time. They kept on hanging me for 2 days that the outfit will be delivered. It was a disheartening exp, waiting for an outfit. I dont think its a set of professional people running this business. Good luck to u guys. Very bad performance.",0,[]
