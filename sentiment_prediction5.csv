"Pathetic customer service, they can ruin your special occasion by not delevering and when you try to contact then they don't left any stone unturned to make you realise you made a big fault",0
"Trusting Flyrobe was a big mistake. I booked a Raymond suit and got carefree as I thought my dress would be delivered to me before the party. But no, there was no sign of any callback from flyrobe, no person came to me for measurements and no calls from flyrobe on the day of delivery. I kept trying their customer are, no one picked up the call. I had to make last minute arrangements for my party. Next day I get a message from them that the order was cancelled by them unfortunately and they apologized for inconvenience. So simple for them ! They would have atleast called me and told me about this before or on the delivery date. This is a very naive startup and my very first experience with them got really bad. I won't be using this app again.",0
"The delivery was 18 hrs late.the delivery guy was abusive,drunk hurling abuses for distubing his drinking plan with his buddies.the armpit of the dress was sweat stained and had stenching odour.have filed a police complaint against the delivery guy and a claim against flyrobe at consumer forum.",0
In the beginning they were having huge and wonderful Collection with less price. Now they dont have good collection but rent are higher .,0
It sucks when they don't response to the msgs and provide wrong info,0
Horrible app. They neither deliver nor communicate.,0
Can you plz anyone given referl code,0
Highly Dispointed. I had ordered a Lehenga set and the delivery date was 3rd of may. If never delivered and my day was ruined. Not going to try this ever again. Cheats.,1
Okay not bad to collectionS,0
More than 15 Days have passed and they still haven't returned the security money. The fitting of the clothes were done horribly. I've been emailing and calling everyday still no response!!! No one even receives the calls!!! Extremely bad service. I would never recommend this app to anyone.,1
"HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FALSELY ACCUSING OF NOT RETURNING THE PRODUCT!!!!!! It has been 17 days since i returned the lehenga. I still haven't received the security money. I have sent so many emails and called so many times. Now after 17 days you're telling me that the dupatta is missing??! I packed everything properly and returned your product in very good condition. I had nothing to do with the missing dupatta! You might want to ask your delivery boy about that! Or maybe this is just what you say so that you don't have to refund the security. I want my security money back! It was even a lot more than the actual rent amount of the lehenga. I will never recommend this app to anyone but suggest people not to use it. Why would you do quality check after 17 days of receiving the product?? Your way of managing things is very very poor. If i could give minus stars, i would! Highly disappointed!!",1
There is no option for my city? Sambalpur,0
They didn't deliver the product at last moment and didn't bother to contact me. Worst serviceâ. You can't contact their customer care.,1
"worst service, tailor came for only buildup, then send different size low quality cloths, 1st uninsatall this bludy app, and dont buy from this app, better go to any outlet and pick 4000RS sherwanis,",1
Very bad experienceð,0
Service is not good.,0
I am not able to login from any platform...,0
Bakwaas,0
Worst experience ever,0
They are fraud and pathetic people. No professionalism as they do not even bother to pick up your phone. They haven't returned the security yet and it's been more than 25 days even after calling them many times. I would seriously suggest not to order through the this app if you don't want to ruin your event as they do sometimes do not deliver your clothes on time. Totally hated the experience words cannot describe it.,0
Very poor. App stops while making payments. Nobody picks the call or respond to mail's. Waste of time,0
"Worst ever delivery service. Called customer care more than 100 times no answer, didn't received the delivery on the day expected totally spoiled my event.",0
I ordered a dress almost a week before the event they came and took the measurements I got a confirmation way in advance that I will get the dress however on the day of the event I got a call from them just a few hours before the event that my dress cannot be delivered and I did not have any backup never ordering from flyrobe ever again and you definitely not recommend it to anyone.,0
Not an Trustworthy app...rented a jacket for occasion .. But on the delivery date I was told that it was not available. Don't rely on this app they might deliver you anything or nothing.. Uninstalling it ryt now.,0
No one came for taking measurements or for delivery. It has been almost 10 days since i ordered the dress I still have not received it though my delivery date was 10th May.,0
I downloaded this app today. I saw the mrp of few dresses higher than the actual price of that dress. Am not convinced by this app. Also there are no referral code while login and no coupon. Not a good app.,0
Theres no way for it to be shipped to the US. Id like to think that would be a primary fact to mention somewhere in the discription??,0
Worst customer service ever. They lie right under your nose and tell you that the outfit will be delivered but the next day they tell you that they haven't even started to process the order. The call centre is pathetic as you need to call them a million times before someone picks it up and puts you on hold again. Extremely disappointing. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone,0
Thr services just completely sucks..spoiled my birthday..never gonna use flyrobe evr again..the app is too good..bt again thr service SUCKS...!!!!,0
"Hi, These are people are fraud. They don't deliver the product when you buy stuff. They make the product delivery status as delivered without delivering the same. Please do not buy stuff from here. Also if you're buying, don't pay before hand. Inspite of reaching their customer care so many times, they don't reply.",0
Guyzzz... Please don't go with this app.. It's MRP rate is more than original rate... It's fake app where there are making fool of us...big cheaters,0
Fraud.,0
Do not trust them.till the 13 th hour I was made to wait for the costume...n then after cancellation from their end I received a Ill fitting dress...on complaining they promised for a substitute...n later they r asking a whopping price for the same...I dint get dress at last...I was suppose to go for a wedding a day prior...but couldn't bcoz of the fiasco...plz do not fall prey to them,0
Not working after latest update,0
"Customer care and complaint section is very weak. Super late, but they replied, that's why 2 stars else you deserve 1 star for my incident...",1
Utterly worthless and unprofessional. I placed two orders and both of them got cancelled turn by turn. One was 'damaged' and the other was cancelled by them without caring for an explanation. I placed my trust on them and waited till the last hour of an important wedding but the dress didn't turn up. Constant calling and pleading didn't help as the 'Customer Care' doesn't actually care.,0
As soon as I updated the app. I can't see anything. Everything I search ends in a blank page.,0
Disgusting app. Is not working at all. I've even sent them the email please do check,0
"I had this app in my phone an year ago.. i used to mark dresses, they were so lovely and beautiful.. now when i need to use this app, i reinstalled it, and then immediately uninstalled it.. why the collection is sooooo soooo less.. in skirt section, only 3 skirts.. in shorts 1.. in jumpsuit 5.. i didn't believe my eyes.. hate this app now",0
How do you sell those present in your shop for such premium.?,0
"Worst experience please don't download this app, they spoilt my wedding I waited the whole day for delivery finally they stopped picking my call worst service.",0
Useless app n also useless store in mumbai..... Today we visited the store in mumbai... Lady who was not at all bother to take care of customers... Like she was avoiding and not entertaining the customers.... And about app.... App shows many variety but in actual store has very limited options....of we order stuff Other than available in the store they get cancel it on last moment saying piece is damaged,0
Flyrobe and on time delivery never go hand in hand. Thanks Flyrobe for screwing up my FAREWELL function.,1
Never ever trust their word on delivery. Worst ever service experienced.,0
Worst service.. Don't trust on these guys. They don't deliver on time and the product quality is pathetic. No customer feedback. #Disappointed,1
Totally a fraud app they just cheat.will deliver d.goods which u haven't ordered and than later on deny to return n refund as well a cheated app,0
Worst ever app..,0
"Pethetic service,worst quality dresses",0
"Hey flyrobe, care to even inform your customers before cancelling orders? Last I heard your team would call me and take up my concern .. it's been 2 weeks now .. I haven't heard from you guys! If u cannot serve customers well, do not enter into this business .. shame on u guys!",1
Pathetic,0
Flyrobe should extend their service to other cities also...it should not be limited to handful of cities. I am in Kanpur but flyrobe isn't available here,0
"Seem like fake , not good than other sites",0
Useless site no options and the rental prices are very high....,0
They wnt deliver the product on time.. And they wnt even care about that.... Will never ever rely on them for their hideously bad service,0
It Goob,0
"Initially when this app started it got grt collections and at amazing price n varities, recently the collection dropped down sharply (specially for Delhi NCR) and amonst very few things, what ever we think to choose they r already pre books. suggested to increase the number of clothes and take the clothes off the rake of it's not available in a real time basis.",1
"You guys should really shut shop - your operations is the worst! Probably the worst fashion ecom service available! The sizes are not as per standard sizing, the person who Oyeindrilla is the worst when it comes to customer service. The team accepted the return and confirmed the same- once confirm she comes back it's not eligible - there is absolutely nothing mentioned in the return policy. Save yourself the headache and Stay away from flyrobe!",0
Very good collection in excellent prices but app is way toooo slow.. that's a little annoying.,0
Useless,0
It should be available in all the cities. That's the biggest drawback of this app.,0
"Worst people to deal with. I had placed my first order bearing order number MMR 065756, with them on 22 april' 2017 for a two pc raymond suit on a rental period for 4 days. I was suppose to receive the suit delivery on 25th april'17. Since nobody turned up till 25th, i called their help line number regarding status of my rented suit, i was given assurance that it will be delivered by 26th evening anyhow. Even on 26th evening, nobody turned up from flyrobe, i called the helpline number but nobody answered the call. Now on 27th april'17, wedding day of my cousin, i again called the helpline number, again i was given assurance of the delivery deadline by 5 pm. Again nobody turned up and they never bothered to call me about the status of my order. I had to attain my cousins wedding in simple formal attire. These people are not fit to do any business, lack ethical responsibility, no follow up of order. Small startup like these cannot ever flourish. I suggest everyone dont get fooled by these peoples.",0
No refund even after 20 days. Had to call many times to customer support. Still no refund. Don't make mistake of ordering stuff from Flyrobe they won't refund you money.,0
The app keeps crashing when I tried to log on with Facebook. Images do no load.,0
Bhai log Kya bakchodi hai ððBhaade pe b kapde Milne lage online,0
"The updated version of the app is really bad and has lot of bugs in it.. Gives error while applying filters, while adding product to the cart. Please get this rectified it's pathetic",0
After update the app does not work.,0
Worst App...,0
"Order no. MMR075736 - Today is my sister's wedding and I don't have any suit to wear. I trusted Flyrobe to deliver suit today but after calling 4-5 times only reply I get is ""sorry for the inconvenience the coat can't be delivered today due to logistics problem"", also when asked if I can visit flyrobe store in Santa Cruz . The reply was in such short notice We won't be able to give court in such short notice"". What kind of customer service is this and is this the way a customer should be treated when I booked the order on 6th August. This is totally unacceptable and breach of trust. My evening is spoiled because of this . I regret placing order on flyrobe",0
no western wear collection available.ð,0
useless,0
I love the concept. I hate that despite multiple mails this app has crashed at least 20 times in the last month,0
Concept is good... But what's with your app... You don't have a search option...,1
Your app crashes way too much,0
App just keeps crashing all the time. Tried ordering through website but never got the items on time,0
Concept is good.. app is horrible.. keeps crashing,0
Placing and canceling order is such a big hassle. App is not at all user friendly. Very disappointed with the collection. Users must try other renting portals like RENT IT BAE. They have amazing collection and their services are top notch,0
Why this service is not available in bhubaneswar?,0
App opens with a blank page,0
Such a fake and pathetic service . They make you wait until the day of event and send you some stupid message saying they cannot service your area and take away your money . Customer service is so bad that they just out you in hold and disconnect. My suggestion to all users us pls don't try Flyrobe they will make your event a big disappointment .....,1
The app doesn't work everytime I install it. Keeps crashing. Can't see a thing. Always blank. Pls fix it.,0
Horrible customer care!! It's almost been a month since my deposit is pending with them! No reply to emails either! Just horrible.,0
"FAKE Flyrobe: They never deliver the clothes on time & coupon codes in offer section are not working; team said this is a technical error and this coupon is showing by mistake in your login , they advice me to update my app; but after uninstall & reinstall that offer is still showing and I can't able to use it,, Finally Uninstalled the APP",0
"They are all frauds, I ordered an outfit on 11Sep, and today I got a call that outfit is not available in 42 size, I have a screenshot that It was available. Today, when only 2 days have left, I have no option to do. They all are fakers. Worst experience, I definitely will not spare them all.",0
Worst app ever they fool you dresses are so costly you can literally buy them at that price worst experience ever.,0
Worst experience ever,0
Worst service and Pathetic experience with Flyrobe. Ordered 1 month before and a day before delivery they cancelled saying we can't deliver at your place as our courier person can't find your house. I live at a very reputed area and my house is very easy to find but somehow they can't find my place and even no-one contacted me to get my address WORST EXCUSE. Please friends don't use their service otherwise you will left with nothing.,1
When I open the app I'm unable to see anything there . I tried so much and even uninstall n install it again,0
Too costly........ People's can buy new clothes as compare in rental price with new style.,1
I don't know what's the problem with this. It's just keep crushing the time I proceed with my cell no. Worst app experience without using it.,0
"Extremely poor service, I provided measurements two days ago, was informed in the morning that the outfit will be delivered today. But now they called to advise that they are not delivering. I was supposed to wear it tomorrow, have no back. Such an embarrassing situation.",0
Horrible collection,0
Very bad app,0
I have ordered a dress and they have showed me that it will be delivered to me on 7th oct between 1pam -8 pm And when i didnt get my product at 1pm then i called them and asked about the stat they were continuosly saying that it will reach you by 8 pm but at 7:30 i spoke to a senior person an he said that we wont be able to deliver you today then i asked what to do i am having event . so they said that you can go for the alternative but there was no tum for the alternative the whole team miss guided and not given a single option to do someting it was event whuch can change my life alvut just they ruined it if i wint be able tobperfirm in the show tommorow i will ladge a complain and even will commit suicide and this flyrobe is responsible for this i want my rented dress st any cost by tommorow 5 o clock morning,0
"I gave 4 because of their late messaging system. I received messages regarding something which already happen. Outdated message which will sure be helpful if sent on time. Also very useless online chat option, never gave answer instantly. I asked question yesterday and did not get reply till now. It's waste of time, but I must say customer service over the phone is good. They are helpful and polite. Good job!!!",1
"I have not seen a more irresponsible company in my life. I gave my wedding lehnga as a part of ""make money off your closet"" campaign launched by flyrobe and looks like flyrobe is the one making money out of my attire. It's been 3 months and I have been following up with them about the lehnga and the dashboard they promised. Everytime I call I hear a scripted apology note and a promise that they l straighten things out. They know how to make stories but absolutely fall short on taking action. In 3 months there was no follow up emails... You can be lucky if they pick up your call. Would strongly discourage anyone from falling in their trap of the fancy campaigns they run. It's just a way of robbing people and making money off of it.",1
it's a little demotivating to see no options for plus size,0
Super,0
"Guys don't go there,over the call they said we will stitch size for every sherwani but when I went there store people said we don't stitch and mine was only 1 size available there and clothes are very bad not in good condition..so don't go and waste your time..I went from Ghaziabad to Rajouri and what I got is only Frustration. Simply chutiya bna rahe ha bhai..",1
Oops Something went wrong is this your welcome screen; cos I am unable go any further in your app... My net is working fine...I tried with both my mobile numbers...but still getting the same error.ð¡,0
"Had to uninstall because it asks for personal information unnecessarily. Asks your phone number, asks to link your social identity.",0

I had a lovely experience with flyrobe. It helped when i was not able to shop and even was not willing to spent much. It was pocket friendly as well as high quality.,1
Their services won't let you ever be disappointed. Their follow ups are definitely the quickest than most other service providers. The best thing is that the way they deliver their products! It's definitely a wonderfully exciting feeling when we receive the huge box! Definitely a box of happiness! And as they are expanding you can order it in various places! They cater to all types of wear! And their pricing is easily affordable! So don't think twice before you download this app! You won't regret it!,1
For how long we can rent the dress and what would be the charges. please revert asap as I need a dress,0
Loved it...keep it up..awesome collection & best service,0
Now flyrobe should try for footwears as well,0
