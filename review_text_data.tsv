1178	Trusting Flyrobe was a big mistake. I booked a Raymond suit and got carefree as I thought my dress would be delivered to me before the party. But no, there was no sign of any callback from flyrobe, no person came to me for measurements and no calls from flyrobe on the day of delivery. I kept trying their customer are, no one picked up the call. I had to make last minute arrangements for my party. Next day I get a message from them that the order was cancelled by them unfortunately and they apologized for inconvenience. So simple for them ! They would have atleast called me and told me about this before or on the delivery date. This is a very naive startup and my very first experience with them got really bad.

21	HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FALSELY ACCUSING OF NOT RETURNING THE PRODUCT!!!!!! It has been 17 days since i returned the lehenga. I still haven't received the security money. I have sent so many emails and called so many times. Now after 17 days you're telling me that the dupatta is missing??! I packed everything properly and returned your product in very good condition. I had nothing to do with the missing dupatta! You might want to ask your delivery boy about that! Or maybe this is just what you say so that you don't have to refund the security. I want my security money back! It was even a lot more than the actual rent amount of the lehenga. I will never recommend this app to anyone but suggest people not to use it. Why would you do quality check after 17 days of receiving the product?? Your way of managing things is very very poor. If i could give minus stars, i would! Highly disappointed!!		1	False	True	"(S

Since nobody turned up till 25th, i called their help line number regarding status of my rented suit, i was given assurance that it will be delivered by 26th evening anyhow. Even on 26th evening, nobody turned up from flyrobe, i called the helpline number but nobody answered the call. Now on 27th april'17, wedding day of my cousin, i again called the helpline number, again i was given assurance of the delivery deadline by 5 pm. Again nobody turned up and they never bothered to call me about the status of my order. I had to attain my cousins wedding in simple formal attire.

28	"I have not seen a more irresponsible company in my life. I gave my wedding lehnga as a part of ""make money off your closet"" campaign launched by flyrobe and looks like flyrobe is the one making money out of my attire. It's been 3 months and I have been following up with them about the lehnga and the dashboard they promised. Everytime I call I hear a scripted apology note and a promise that they l straighten things out. They know how to make stories but absolutely fall short on taking action. In 3 months there was no follow up emails... You can be lucky if they pick up your call. Would strongly discourage anyone from falling in their trap of the fancy campaigns they run. It's just a way of robbing people and making money off of it."		1	False	True	"(S

27	Flyrobe had got me very excited when I read about it on Facebook for the first time, as this concept is awesome and releases half of our worries to look exclusive for occasions. My first experience was a little shaky with them but they were all ears to my queries and did manage to resolve it eventually. the second experience was great and I cannot wait for the 3rd and many moreâ¦.Big thanks to the entire team for running this conceptâ¦Good luck :)		4	True	False	"(S

11	Its a perfect concept.The prices are also very reasonable and have a great collection. Just a small tip- it should have the option of offering our branded stuff for rent too and it should have a bigger collection in western wear and bags and bling.

You should do your homework and if you have any issue their helpline is amazing. I've had a lovely experience with you guys. Yes there were a little bit technical faults which were solved quickly.
