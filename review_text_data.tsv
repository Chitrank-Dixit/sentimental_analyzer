But no, there was no sign of any callback from flyrobe, no person came to me for measurements and no calls from flyrobe on the day of delivery. I kept trying their customer are, no one picked up the call. I had to make last minute arrangements for my party. Next day I get a message from them that the order was cancelled by them unfortunately and they apologized for inconvenience. So simple for them !

21	HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FALSELY ACCUSING OF NOT RETURNING THE PRODUCT!!!!!! It has been 17 days since i returned the lehenga. I still haven't received the security money. I have sent so many emails and called so many times. Now after 17 days you're telling me that the dupatta is missing??! I packed everything properly and returned your product in very good condition. I had nothing to do with the missing dupatta! You might want to ask your delivery boy about that! Or maybe this is just what you say so that you don't have to refund the security. I want my security money back! It was even a lot more than the actual rent amount of the lehenga. I will never recommend this app to anyone but suggest people not to use it. Why would you do quality check after 17 days of receiving the product?? Your way of managing things is very very poor. If i could give minus stars, i would! Highly disappointed!!		1	False	True
