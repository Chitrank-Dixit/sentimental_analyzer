True,False,"Trusting Flyrobe was a big mistake. I booked a Raymond suit and got carefree as I thought my dress would be delivered to me before the party. But no, there was no sign of any callback from flyrobe, no person came to me for measurements and no calls from flyrobe on the day of delivery. I kept trying their customer are, no one picked up the call. I had to make last minute arrangements for my party. Next day I get a message from them that the order was cancelled by them unfortunately and they apologized for inconvenience. So simple for them ! They would have atleast called me and told me about this before or on the delivery date. This is a very naive startup and my very first experience with them got really bad. I won't be using this app again.",0,1

I've been emailing and calling everyday still no response!!! No one even receives the calls!!! Extremely bad service. I would never recommend this app to anyone.,1,1
True,False,"HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FALSELY ACCUSING OF NOT RETURNING THE PRODUCT!!!!!! It has been 17 days since i returned the lehenga. I still haven't received the security money. I have sent so many emails and called so many times. Now after 17 days you're telling me that the dupatta is missing??! I packed everything properly and returned your product in very good condition. I had nothing to do with the missing dupatta! You might want to ask your delivery boy about that! Or maybe this is just what you say so that you don't have to refund the security. I want my security money back! It was even a lot more than the actual rent amount of the lehenga. I will never recommend this app to anyone but suggest people not to use it. Why would you do quality check after 17 days of receiving the product?? Your way of managing things is very very poor. If i could give minus stars, i would! Highly disappointed!!",0,1

One was 'damaged' and the other was cancelled by them without caring for an explanation. I placed my trust on them and waited till the last hour of an important wedding but the dress didn't turn up.

Now on 27th april'17, wedding day of my cousin, i again called the helpline number, again i was given assurance of the delivery deadline by 5 pm. Again nobody turned up and they never bothered to call me about the status of my order. I had to attain my cousins wedding in simple formal attire.

Everytime I call I hear a scripted apology note and a promise that they l straighten things out. They know how to make stories but absolutely fall short on taking action. In 3 months there was no follow up emails... You can be lucky if they pick up your call. Would strongly discourage anyone from falling in their trap of the fancy campaigns they run.
